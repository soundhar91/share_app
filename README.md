This is a simple chrome extension to share your URL to your facebook friends quickly.

This is not in chrome web store yet. But if you want to try how it works, follow these instructions.

Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox:
The menu's icon is three horizontal bars.. and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).

Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.

Click Load unpacked extensionâ€¦ to pop up a file-selection dialog.

Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it.

If the extension is valid, it'll be loaded up and active right away! If it's invalid, an error message will be displayed at the top of the page. Correct the error, and try again.

Please be aware that i haven't had time to test it completely. If you find bug(s) please raise a bug ticket here. Thanks & enjoy.
